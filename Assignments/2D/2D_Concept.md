# 2D Game Concept Paper

As a group write a 500-750 word paper that:
  - Describes the design goals for your game.
  - Describes the core gameplay you hope to accomplish.
  - References any games that serve as inspiration.
  - Outlines your development process going forward (How are you planning on making the game with the time you have? How are you splitting up the work?)

This will be worth 4 points and will be incorporated into the grade for the 2D game. 1 point will be awarded for answering each of the above questions.

This will serve as the "Inspiration and Intention" section of your next process paper!

Due on 2/29. Since this is intented to guide your design process, it must be submitted on the deadline. **Late submissions will not be accepted.**
