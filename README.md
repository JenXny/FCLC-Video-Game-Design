**Course Code:** CISC 2540
**Schedule:** Mondays and Thursdays, 2:30 - 3:45 PM
**Instructor:** John Bezark

## **Course Description:**
An introductory course exploring the fundamentals of digital game design and development. This course will use Godot 4 as the primary game creation tool, and it wil cover the basics of game development, coding fundamentals, and game design principles. Students will engage in hands-on projects to develop practical skills in both 2D and 3D game design. Students are not expected to have any prior programming or game design experience.

## **Course Objectives:**
- Understand the principles of game design and development.
- Gain proficiency in Godot 4.
- Develop basic coding skills relevant to game design.
- Complete three major game design projects: a tabletop game, a 2D game, and a 3D game.
- Enhance writing and oral presentation skills through game-related assignments.
- Be able to better work in teams
- Respond to critical feedback constructively

# **Assessment**

The  work of the class consists of the following:

A note on workload:
  Yes, this sounds like a lot of work! However please note that the final project is an **evolution** of one of the existing projects. Additionally, all the process papers are co-written by the group and are meant to help with designing the game itself. There is very little research or reading in the course. This is a new course, so if this workload is intimidating, let me know and it can potentially be adjusted!
